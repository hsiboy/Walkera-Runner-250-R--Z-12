### The Walkera Runner 250(R)-Z-12

* ATMega 2560 8-bit RISC-based microcontroller - 256KB ISP flash memory, 8KB SRAM, 4KB EEPROM.		
* MPU-6050 Six-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer) MEMS - Motion Processing Unit.		
* HMC5883L 3-Axis Digital Compass IC (via/within GPS module)		
* MS5611-01BA03 High resolution Altimeter.		
* FT232RQ USB to serial UART interface.		
* GPS module contains BeStar BS-300 with the Cirocomm T0010 GPS antenna and compass (see above).		

It would appear then that the Walkera Runner 250 Advnance (R) flight controller is based on the Cirus AIOP flight controller, compare the specifications.

#### MPU-6050 Six-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer) MEMS
The MPU-6050 devices combine a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die, together with an onboard Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™), which processes complex 6-axis MotionFusion algorithms. The device can access external magnetometers or other sensors through an auxiliary master I²C bus, allowing the devices to gather a full set of sensor data without intervention from the system processor.		

#### MS561101BA03-50
The MS561101BA03-50 is a new generation of high resolution Altimeter Sensor with SPI and I²C bus interface. It is optimized for altimeters and variometers with an altitude resolution of 10cm. The sensor module includes a high linearity pressure sensor and an ultra low power 24-bit ΔΣ ADC with internal factory calibrated coefficients. It provides a precise digital 24-bit pressure and temperature value and different operation modes that allow the user to optimize for conversion speed and current consumption. A high resolution temperature output allows the implementation of an altimeter/thermometer function without any additional sensor. It can be interfaced to virtually any microcontroller. The communication protocol is simple, without the need of programming internal registers in the device. Small dimensions of only 5.0 x 3.0mm and a height of only 1.0mm allow for integration in mobile devices.		
* High Resolution Module (10cm).
* Low-power, 1µA (Standby <0.15µA).
* Integrated Digital Pressure Sensor (24-bit ΔΣ ADC).
* I²C and SPI Interface up to 20MHz.
* No External Components (Internal Oscillator).
* 10 to 1200mbar Operating Range.
